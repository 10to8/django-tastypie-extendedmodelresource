 Django TastyPie's Extended ModelResource
==========================================

The ``ExtendedModelResource`` is an extension for TastyPie's ModelResource that adds some interesting features.

* Supports easily using resources as "nested" of another resource, with proper authorization checks for each case.
* Supports using a custom identifier attribute for resources in uris (not only the object's pk!)
